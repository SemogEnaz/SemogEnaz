# Zane Gomes

Hi, welcome to my GitHub repo. Here I showcase the various projects I've worked on in my time and for university.

## About me

I am a university student studying at Monah. I'm enrolled in Monah's **Software Engineering** course. Currently, I'm focusing on improving my skills and versatility as a **Web Developer**. The reason I choose web development as my field of expertise is that it allows me to have access to the apps I build on any device that can run a browser and my apps can be accessed from anywhere one would have an internet connection.

## Tech I work with

 Frontend: React
  Backend: Nodejs, Nextjs, Django
Databases: MySQL
Scripting: Python
   DevOps: Nginx

## Current 

Recently I've been interested in DevOps. I've been looking into Nginx, Docker, and CI/CD and hosting my web apps on my GCP VM.
I'm also interested in looking into projects involving web sockets for live data transmission.
